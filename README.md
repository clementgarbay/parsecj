ParsecJ
============

# Introduction

**ParsecJ** is a Java monadic parser combinator framework for constructing LL(1) parsers.
It is based on the
[Parsec paper](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/daan/download/papers/parsec-paper.pdf),
which describes a monadic parsing framework implemented in Haskell.
Note, the implementation of the Haskell Parsec library has changed considerably since the paper.

## Parser Combinators

The standard approach to implementing parsers for special-purpose languages
is to use a parser generation tool,
such as Yacc/Bison and ANTLR.
With these tools the language is defined using a grammar language specific to the tool.
The parsing code is then generated from the language grammar.

An alternative approach is to implement a
[recursive descent parser](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_descent_parser),
whereby the production rules comprising your language grammar
are translated by hand into parse functions.
One limitation of this approach
is that the extra plumbing required to implement error-handling and backtracking
obscures the correspondence between the parsing functions and the language rules.

[Monadic parser combinators](http://www.artima.com/pins1ed/combinator-parsing.html)
are a extension of recursive descent parsing,
which use a monad to encapsulate the plumbing.
The framework provides the basic building blocks -
parsers for constituent language elements such as characters, words and numbers.
It also provides combinators which construct more complex parsers by composing existing parsers.
The framework effectively provides a Domain Specific Language for expressing language grammars,
whereby each grammar instance implements an executable parser.

## Example

As a quick illustration of how a simple parser looks when implemented using ParsecJ,
consider the following example.

```java
intr.bind(x ->
    satisfy('+')
        .then(intr.bind(y ->
            retn(x+y))))
```

Here a parser is defined, which will parse and evaluate expressions of the form *a+b* where *a* and *b* are integers.
The parser is constructed by taking the `intr` parser for integers, the `satisfy` parser for single symbols,
and combining them using the `bind`, `then` and `retn` combinators.

This parser can be used as follows:

```java
int i =
    intr.bind(x ->
        satisfy('+')
            .then(intr.bind(y ->
                retn(x+y)
            )
        )
    ).parse(State.of("1+2")).getResult();
```

# Usage

Typically parsers are defined by composing the predefined combinators provided by the library.
In rare cases a parser combinator may need to be implemented by operating directly on the input state.

## Types

### Parser<S, A>

All parsers implement the `org.javafp.parsecj.Parser` interface, which has following method is `parse`:

```java
@FunctionalInterface
public interface Parser<S, A> {
    ConsumedT<S, A> apply(State<S> state);

    default Reply<S, A> parse(State<S> state) {
        return apply(state).getReply();
    }
    // ...
}
```

I.e. a `Parser<S, A>` is essentially a function from a `State<S>` to a `ConsumedT<S, A>`,
where `S` is the input stream symbol type (usually `Character`),
and `A` is the type of the value being parsed.

The `apply` method contains the actual implementation of the parser.
Since the `ConsumedT` type is an internediate type,
the `parse` method is provided to apply and the parser and extract the `Reply` parse result.

### State<S>

The `State<S>` interface is an abstraction representing an immutable input state.
It provides several static `of` methods for constructing `State` instances from sequences of symbols:

```java
public interface State<S> {
    static <S> State<S> of(S[] symbols) {
        return new ArrayState<S>(symbols);
    }

    static State<Character> of(Character[] symbols) {
        return new CharArrayState(symbols);
    }

    static State<Character> of(String symbols) {
        return new StringState(symbols);
    }

    // ...
}
```

### Reply<S, A>

The `ConsumedT<S, A>` object returned by `Parser.apply` is an intermediate result wrapper,
typically only of interest to combinator implementations.
Use the `ConsumedT.getReply` method to obtain the parser result wrapper,
or use the `Parser.parse` method to bypass `ConsumedT` entirely.

A `Reply` can be either a successful parse result (represented by the `Ok` type)
or an error (represented by the `Error` type).
Use the `match` method to handle both cases:

```java
public abstract class Reply<S, A> {
    public abstract <B> B match(Function<Ok<S, A>, B> ok, Function<Error<S, A>, B> error);
    // ...
}
```

E.g.:

```java
String msg =
    parser.parse("abcd")
        .match(
            ok -> "Result : " + ok.getResult(),
            error -> "Error : " + error.getMsg()
        );
```

## Defining Parsers

A parser for a language is constructed with the library by translating the production rules comprising the language grammar into parsers,
by using the combinators provided by the library.

### Combinators

The `org.javafp.parsecj.Combinators` package provides the following basic combinator parsers:

Name | Description | Returns
-----|-------------|--------
`retn(value)` | A parser which always succeeds | The supplied value.
`bind(p, f)` | A parser which first applies the parser `p`. If it succeeds it then applies the function `f` to the result to `fail()` | A parser which always fails. | An Error
`satisfy(test)` | Applies a test to the next input symbol. | The symbol.
`satisfy(value)` | A parser which succeeds if the next input symbol equals `value`. | The symbol
`eof()` | A parser which succeeds if the end of the input is reached. | UNIT.
yield another parser which is then applied. | Result of `q`
`then(p, q)` | A parser which first applies the parser `p`. If it succeeds it then applies parser `q`. | Result of `q`.
`or(p, q)` | A parser which first applies the parser `p`. If it succeeds the result is returned otherwise it applies parser `q`. | Result of succeeding parser.
... |

Combinators which take a `Parser` as a first parameter, such as `bind`,
also exist as methods on the `Parser` interface, to allow parsers to be constructed in a fluent style.
E.g. `p.bind(f)` is equivalent to `bind(p, f)`.

### Text

The `org.javafp.parsecj.Text` package provides in addition to the parsers in `Combinators`,
the following parsers specialised for parsing text input:

Name | Description | Returns
-----|-------------|--------
`alpha` | A parser which succeeds if the next character is alphabetic. | The character.
`digit` | A parser which succeeds if the next character is a digit. | The character.
`intr` | A parser which parses an integer. | The integer.
`dble` | A parser which parses an double. | The double.
`string(s)` | A parser which parses the supplied string. | The string.
`alphaNum` | A parser which parses an alphanumeric string. | The string.
`regex(regex)` | A parser which parses a string matching the supplied regex. | The string matching the regex.

### Parser Monad

The `retn` and `bind` combinators are slightly special as they are what make `Parser` a monad.
The key point is that they observe the [3 monad laws](https://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Monad_laws):

1. **Left Identity** : `retn(a).bind(f)` = `f.apply(a)`
1. **Right Identity** : `p.bind(x -> retn(x)` = `p`
1. **Associativity** : `p.bind(f).bind(g)` = `p.bind(x -> f.apply(x).bind(g))`

where `p` and `q` are parsers, `a` is a parse result, and `f` a function from a parse result to a parser.

The first two laws tell us that `retn` is the identity the `bind` operation.
The third law tells us the when we have two parser expressions being combined with the `bind` method and function `f`, then the order in which the parsers are constructed has no effect on the result.
This becomes relevant for the fluent chaining usage,
as it means we do not to worry too much about bracketing when chaining parsers.
